        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>The majority of my thirty years in telecomm were spent in technical support roles for the sales organization. It was my responsibility to understand the underlying technology of the products that we sold and act as a subject matter expert both internally and in front of all levels in the customers organization. In this role I supported a broad portfolio of products and services. That portfolio included WAN networking (MPLS, Frame Relay, and IP), Managed Network Services (routers, switches, security appliances), Hosting Services (datacenters, servers, applications), Wireless Networks and Devices (handsets, modems, M2M, fixed wireless), and Professional Services (wiring, implemenation, project management, construction).</p>

        <h2>Personal Experience</h2>
        <p>I can best be described as "diverse" when it comes to my interests and experiences outside of work. I enjoy hunting and fishing and just being outside. I enjoy the companionship and working ability of dogs specific to hunting. Working with my hands in creative projects like woodcut printing and building things is a favorite past time. I also enjoy providing for others in the community and have served at the local homeless shelter kitchen cooking meals. I have two children and enjoy traveling with them and showing them places that I have been and things that I have done.</p>
